"output.zip" file contains all output files generated by source code. 
If you want to skip some steps of the process when re-producing results, please uncompress the "output.zip" file 
and move the contents into the output folder of clonned repo, as some steps use the previous step's output (For example enrichment analysis 
uses the output of the em algorithm). If you want to run the whole process with an empty output folder, please create "cafa_raw_predictions" 
and "em_algorithm" folders inside "output" folder.
